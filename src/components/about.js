        <p>From commodore 64 till today I always wanted to do more with computers, I wanted to create something  that  will  bring some  benefit, fun and joy to all users. Prevented  from coding ( yes, life happens) I had  reached a point where I can devote myself to web development and professional growth. Right now I am looking to join a team of like-minded developers where I can contribute and continue professional development.
