        <p>Recently I finished software engineering Bootcamp in General Assembly where I have gained the foundation of web development and improved my coding skills. With overall good knowledge of web technologies including frontend and backend development processes, and fair understanding of modern web frameworks such are ReactJS and NodeJS, I am looking for a position where personal growth has the same importance as company development.
